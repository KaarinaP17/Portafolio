        <h3>Work Experience</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify">
          <strong>Social Hours:</strong> Currently, I am performing my internal
          social hours at the university, specifically in the Library, where I
          have the responsibility of cubicle on the third level. This role has
          allowed me to develop a meticulous and detailed approach, as I am in
          charge of managing the reservations of the study rooms. My work begins
          by reviewing the calendar and times to make sure every booking is
          correctly recorded. When students show up for use a room, I make sure
          the date and time match the reservation made. This task also implies
          great attention to the detail, as I thoroughly verify that all the
          data is correct before proceeding. Once the details are confirmed, I
          collect the cards of each of the students and I keep them safely while
          they use of the room. Next, I head to open the room, allowing they can
          start their study or group work session.

          of the room is finished, I carry out an inspection to make sure that
          the space is kept in perfect condition. I verify that there is no
          trash, furniture is in place, and the environment is The overall
          function of the room is intact, ready for the next user. In addition
          to these tasks, I have the responsibility of checking the third level
          of the library during my shifts. My goal is ensuring that an
          environment conducive to study is maintained, ensuring that students
          respect silence and do not generate disorder. This work has allowed me
          to develop skills in the time management and problem solving, as I
          must respond efficiently and unobtrusively to any situation you may
          interrupt the study environment.
