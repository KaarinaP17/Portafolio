            I went to Esparza school in Antiguo Cuscatlan to do kindergarten
            when I was 5 years old, I learned to read and write, I made many
            friends, since I was a little girl I liked studying, for which I was
            always one of the students who stood out in the classroom, that same
            year I participated as a puppet for the parade of September 15, the
            month of independence.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I also participated in a swimming competition on behalf of the
            school, I learned to swim when I was 4 and a half years old, and I
            got the third place. At the end of the school year I also won first
            place for best grades, I enjoyed going to school, spending time with
            my friends and my favorite teacher.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I went to kinder 6, and it was a difficult year at first, because I
            had an accident playing with one of my cousins and I broke my right
            arm hahaha, they put me in a cast and I was wearing it for about a
            month, it was hard to get used to it, because it was my arm with
            which I wrote, and I had to learn to write with my left hand, and I
            did not like it because my handwriting was ugly hahaha. After that
            stage it was fun, because they removed the cast and I could write
            with my right hand again, a month later my birthday was coming and
            my mom celebrated it at school with my classmates, my cake was my
            favorite fairy tinker bell.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            That same year I had my graduation, and we started with the
            preparations, practicing dances, learning scripts, and many other
            activities, I had the honor of being the master of ceremony for
            being the student with the highest grades, and having a much more
            advanced reading than my classmates. My favorite part of the
            graduation was when we had the dance and I went out dressed with my
            classmates as a ballet dancer, I had my tutu and my slippers hahaha.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I also had the honor of receiving the first academic place when I
            received my diploma and the school gave me a half scholarship to
            continue studying. At the end of the night I felt very happy for all
            that I had achieved and learned, at the same time I felt sad because
            several friends had to leave the school, and I would not see them
            again.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I went to my first grade, and I started my first cycle, I also
            continued to try as hard as I could, at the end of the first year I
            won the first academic place again, but this time I could no longer
            continue studying at school due to personal problems, my mom had to
            take me out and I entered another school.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            This school was called Liceo Castilla, in which I was until my third
            grade, during those years I carried out many activities in which I
            participated, the school every year had an EXPO scheduled, where
            each grade was prepared to carry out scientific projects, I had the
            honor of taking second place in one of the EXPOS, I also
            participated 2 times in the parades of September 15, where the month
            of independence is celebrated in the country. I also participated
            for queen of the school, in which, a girl from each grade was chosen
            to represent her grade, the activity consisted of selling votes and
            the person who sold the most was named queen of the school and was
            in charge of attending all the events that the school was invited
            to, in which I also had the honor of winning and I was the queen of
            the school for a year hehe.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Then I finished the third grade, and they changed me again, this
            time they put me in a school, which is also located in Antiguo
            Cuscatl√°n, where I started the fourth grade. This drastic stage of
            coming from school and then going to a school was quite difficult
            for me to adapt to the program, but it was not impossible.

          <li><strong>Secondary School Education:</strong></li>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            I continued my studies in that same place, until I finished my ninth
            grade, I obtained many changes as I grew and the years went by,
            likewise, I was always a very active student, I have always liked to
            participate in activities and relate to people, there I had a
            subject of modern dance, which consisted of performing dances which
            had been represented by the country, From the time she enters fourth
            grade until she finishes the third cycle, she participates in the
            dances every year. In ninth grade was the saddest stage, because the
            pandemic came and I could no longer participate in the dances, I did
            not have a graduation and much less promotion.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            But also, when I was in eighth grade, a scholarship program arrived,
            to give us a talk about how the program consisted, they told us that
            they were 3 years, in which they offered 3 subjects, and the
            subjects were: English, Computer Science and Values. Only students
            with great potential and a very good average could participate,
            which my teacher chose me and told me that she wanted me to
            participate in the program that would be a great opportunity for me,
            and so it was, I chose to participate and won the 3-year
            scholarship, I ran the school and the program at the same time. My
            first year in the scholarship was the most difficult, because I
            started it when I started ninth grade, and in that year the pandemic
            happened and we had to be from home receiving the classes and all
            the material, I went to the second year of the scholarship, and I
            did the EXPO of our year, we had to prepare too much, learn scripts
            in English, and at the same time we make a website, in the second
            year is when students must choose a branch
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            In the area of computer science, since we would carry out
            certifications using the programming language we chose, we had the
            options to specialize in: BackEnd, FrontEnd and Data Analyst, and I
            chose the BackEnd branch, it was quite difficult at first to learn
            how to use the programs, but in the end in our EXPO we demonstrated
            with our website everything we had learned. I went to the third year
            of the scholarship and this time we were promoting the program, it
            felt so fun, but at the same time there were many mixed feelings
            since we knew that it was our last year as interns, in that year we
            began with the preparations for the certifications of programming
            languages, as well as with those of MOST EXCEL and TOEIC English, We
            had to study and prepare too much to be able to pass the
            certifications.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            We also began to attend university fairs, so that we would have the
            opportunity to learn more about the career we wanted to study and
            thus also be able to observe the university that best suited us with
            what we wanted to study at the same time. At the same time I was
            studying high school at school, where I met many people, I had the
            opportunity to participate in the activities of the institution, and
            I started with the preparations for the graduation of both places,
            the school and the scholarship program, I had to rehearse scripts
            since I was master of ceremony, first I had the graduation of the
            high school, which was very exciting for me who had already finished
            that academic stage, two months later I had the graduation of the
            program ¬°Superate! which was where I was on a scholarship, I looked
            forward to that day since it had been the most beautiful stage I had
            ever had, I was too happy for my friends who were graduating
            together,

            After having attended university fairs I chose to enter the UCA, I
            started the admission process and since then everything has been
            falling into place, I started university in 2023, I am currently
            studying my fourth cycle, and without a doubt it has been a very
            beautiful path, I have been meeting wonderful people, super
            intelligent and very admirable. I hope in a few years to be able to
            say that I am finally a Computer Engineer!
